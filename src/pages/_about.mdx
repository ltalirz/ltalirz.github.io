I am a computational physicist looking for opportunities to change the world through better materials, science and technology.
I love programming and working on materials challenges together with experimentalists & engineers.

Originally from Berlin, I studied physics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and then spent a decade working as a computational materials scientist in academia, solving natureâ€™s riddles through atomistic simulations and writing software to make materials science more open, reproducible, and accessible. 
In 2021 I joined Microsoft's [Azure Quantum Team](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/) to build [Azure Quantum Elements](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/our-story/quantum-elements-overview), a cloud platform for supercharging atomistic simulations through high-perfomance computing, machine learning, and, eventually, quantum computing. 
Since March 2024, I am with [Schott AG](https://www.schott.com/), a specialty glass manufacturer, in a dual role as expert for materials informatics and head of the computational materials engineering group.
